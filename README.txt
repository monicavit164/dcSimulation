This project allows the simulation of the collection of monitoring data in a datacenter. 
To set the datacenter it is possible to modify the file "DCConfiguration.m".

To execute the simulation run the script "loadSimulation" that executes different load for each Virtual Machine defined in the data center. Modify this script if you add/remove virtual machines. 

At the end of the simulations monitored data are plotted grouped by monitored variable and server.
