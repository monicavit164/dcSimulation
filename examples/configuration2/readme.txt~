This example simulates the monitoring and assessment of a data center with a single server running two virtual machines.

The load has been increased separately for each VM in three steps:

- step 1: load increasing at each step for VM1, load at VM2 is constant
- step 2: load increasing at each step for VM2, load at VM1 is constant
- step 3: load increasing at each step for both VM1 and VM2

To run the example just run loadSimulation.m.
